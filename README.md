# Password Strength Checker & Authentication System

 Project Overview

A comprehensive, production-inspired authentication system demonstrating critical cybersecurity principles including secure password handling, strong authentication, and access control mechanisms.
 Objectives Achieved

✅ **System Design:** 3+ well-designed components with clear separation of concerns  
✅ **Password Strength Validation:** 8+ character requirement, mixed case, numbers, special chars  
✅ **Password Hashing:** SHA-256 one-way encryption  
✅ **User Authentication:** Secure credential verification  
✅ **Access Control:** Account lockout after failed attempts  
✅ **Security Best Practices:** No plain-text storage, input validation, logging
